									Kulwinder Singh Bassi strongly believes that the corporate sector has certain obligations and responsibilities to fulfill towards the society. It was this belief that led to the opening of a world class school in 2009 in his hometown, Phagwara in Punjab, India. Cambridge International School, Phagwara is managed by the Bassi Education Society and it is a one of its kind in the state of Punjab. The school is accredited to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Cambridge International Education UK. It also carries an accreditation that allows the school to use the ISA logo for three years.
